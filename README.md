# NSPN_WhitakerVertes_PNAS2016

This repository is a mirror of the [figshare repository](https://figshare.com/projects/NSPN_Adolescent_consolidation_of_human_connectome_hubs/4710) that contains all the data and analysis code to reproduce the NSPN Manuscript "Adolescence is associated with genomically patterned consolidation of the hubs of the human brain connectome".

### What's in this repo

This repository contains all the data, analysis code and results (including figures and tables) from the NSPN Manuscript "Adolescence is associated with genomically patterned consolidation of the hubs of the human brain connectome". A write up of all the different files and naming structures can be found at the wiki page on [file descriptions](https://github.com/KirstieJane/NSPN_WhitakerVertes_PNAS2016/wiki/File-descriptions).

### Why figshare *and* GitHub?
The repository was created upon acceptance of the paper by PNAS by downloading the project files from [figshare](https://figshare.com/projects/NSPN_Adolescent_consolidation_of_human_connectome_hubs/4710). The Figshare project ensures that our data and code will be stored in perpetuity, but the goal of this GitHub repository is to make it easy for you to both access the files and to ask for help with the process. [Wiki documentation](https://github.com/KirstieJane/NSPN_WhitakerVertes_PNAS2016/wiki) will be built as necessary in response to your questions.

### Support
To ask for help please read the [current issues](https://github.com/KirstieJane/NSPN_WhitakerVertes_PNAS2016/issues) just in case someone has already asked your question or [open a new issue](https://github.com/KirstieJane/NSPN_WhitakerVertes_PNAS2016/issues/new). Please provide as much information as possible and [Kirstie](https://github.com/KirstieJane) will respond as quickly as possible.
